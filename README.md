# code-refactor

## Description
My motivation for building this application was to refactor an existing web application to make it more accessible for those who experience disabilities that create viewing and understanding information on web applications more difficult than those without these types of disabilities. I decided to build this project because creating an application that is easily utilized by a broader population of users has been an upward trend in web development for some time and is starting to become the career standard (rightfully so; everyone should be able to access the wide wealth of information online regardless of health limitations - hopefully combined with knowledge of what a credible source is, but we are aiming for baby steps here).

Being able to refactor code for a company to accommodate this trend not only benefits those with disabilities, but benefits the company by increasing their web application's visibility on search engines such as Google, increasing traffic to their deployed site, possibly increasing profits for the company. Lastly, having an accessible web application that represents your company avoids any chance of there being complications with litigation with regard to not creating an equally accessible application for all. This refactoring of the company's code they had originally proposed added semantic HTML elements, logical structuring of the HTML elements independent of styling and positioning, accessible alt attributes on image elements, sequential ordering of heading attributes, and created a concise and descriptive title element. All of these edits (or refactors) to their originally proposed code created a web application that does not discriminate based on how well the user can access or utilize it based on health issues out of their control.

From refactoring the code the company originally gave me, I gained a broader understanding of the specific elements of a web application that are needed in order to make sure anyone with accessibility issues can understand and navigate the application as well as someone without disabilities. Creating an equal opportunity for those who struggle with daily life tasks (in something most people don't consider there to be accommodations incorporated into) in other areas by doing something as simple as refactoring code to make their life easier, is honestly a very rewarding, beneficial impact coding can have on society I was completely unaware of beforehand. Litigation motivations aside, it brings a smile to my face knowing I made someone's life that much easier.

## Installation

To install this application, there are two ways to access the refactored website. The first is to install the code from this repository. Once done, unzip the folder, and open the unzipped folder into a coding program of your choice (ex. Visual Studio Code). For this installation example, we will use Visual Studio Code. To do this, open Visual Studio Code and click on the "File" tab in the upper left-hand corner of the program. Then, click "Open Folder". Navigate to the unzipped folder on your computer and then click "Select Folder". Visual Studio Code will now have loaded the repository code and its associated files. Right-click the "index.html" file and click "Open with Live Server". The refactored web application should now load in your browser of choice.

The other way to access the refactored website is much easier. Simply access the deployed refactoring of the company's web application by clicking the link in the upper right-hand corner of this repository underneath the repository's brief description section (highlighted in blue).

## Usage
An example of how one can utilize the newly refactored web application (with increased accessibility in mind) is shown in the following screenshot:

Notice how the heading of the refactored web application (on the left tab) has an easier to understand title, while the non-refactored web application (shown on the right tab) has little to distinguish itself from any other tabs one might have opened.

Another way that the refactored web application improved accessibility is by making sure the links located within the headers of the web application (as shown in the following screenshot) actually link the user to that part of the site without having to scroll down. When the user now clicks on the "Search Image Optimization" header, for example, they will be redirected to that portion of the web application as shown below:

Will now redirect the user down to the "Search Image Optimization" portion of the web application without scrolling required: [![Screenshot-2023-07-30-235755.png](https://i.postimg.cc/vTYDMJnS/Screenshot-2023-07-30-235755.png)](https://postimg.cc/BLzJBwMx)
